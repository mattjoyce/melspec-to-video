Change my mind on some features

- Added Project Path to argparse and config
  If the folder is not specified, generated files will be dumped in cwd
  If is specified but does not exist - error, exit

- removed --dated
  good for testing but not that useful.

- code does not delete any files when --overwrite is used, but will allow overwriting.

- renamed project_folder to project_path

- switch to pathlib from os.path
