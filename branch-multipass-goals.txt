Branch 'multipass' Goals:

1. Simplify Memory Management:
- Remove complex dynamic memory management features to reduce code complexity.
- Retain memory usage reporting to monitor performance and resource utilization.
- Introduce memory usage warnings based on predefined thresholds to alert on potential issues.

2. Remove Overlay Feature:
- Temporarily remove the playhead and other overlay functionalities to focus on core spectrogram visualization and MP4 generation.
- Plan for reintroduction post-refactoring, ensuring modular and decoupled implementation for easier management and updates.

3. Implement a Multipass Approach:
- Analyze: Conduct a preliminary analysis pass to gather essential data for processing, e.g., calculating the maximum power reference for normalization.
- Generate Spectrograms: In the second pass, generate wide Mel spectrogram images using data from the analysis phase for consistent visual representation.
- Generate Video: In the final pass, create the video from spectrogram images. Implement a sliding window technique for cropping and encoding images into the video format.

Considerations:
- Ensure each pass is clearly defined and modular to facilitate independent testing and optimization.
- Document changes and testing strategies to maintain a clear understanding of modifications and their impact.
- Prepare for the future reintroduction of advanced features by designing with modularity and extensibility in mind.
